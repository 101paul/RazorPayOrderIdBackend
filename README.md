# RazorPay Order ID Backend 💳⚡

This is a **Spring Boot backend service** that integrates with **Razorpay Payment Gateway** to generate **unique Order IDs** whenever a new order is placed.  
It is designed to work seamlessly with my shopping application **[ShopEase](https://github.com/101paul/ShopEase_frBuyer)** 🛒.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Create new Razorpay Orders with unique **Order IDs**  
- ✅ Configurable order details (amount, currency, receipt)  
- ✅ Secure integration with Razorpay using API keys  
- ✅ REST API endpoint to be consumed by Android app / frontend  
- ✅ Cross-Origin enabled (CORS) for external clients  

---

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Java 21**  
- **Spring Boot** (REST API)  
- **Razorpay Java SDK** (`com.razorpay:razorpay-java:1.4.5`)  
- **Gradle** (build tool)

## 🔐 Security

API keys (razorpay.key_id, razorpay.key_secret) are stored in application.properties

This file is excluded from GitHub via .gitignore to prevent accidental leaks of sensitive credentials.

These keys are required to authenticate with Razorpay and create secure orders. Without them, no valid order can be generated.

Every order created gets a unique Order ID generated by Razorpay.

**👉 Why is this important?**

- Without a unique order ID, all transactions would be indistinguishable — making order tracking, refunds, and payments reconciliation impossible.

- Unique IDs ensure that multiple orders can be handled concurrently in a production system without conflict.

- This is critical for apps like ShopEase, where hundreds of customers may place orders at the same time.

- By keeping credentials secure and letting Razorpay generate unique immutable order IDs, we guarantee:

- ✅ Data integrity (no duplicate orders)

- ✅ Traceability (each order can be tracked individually)

- ✅ Scalability (application can handle many concurrent transactions safely)
